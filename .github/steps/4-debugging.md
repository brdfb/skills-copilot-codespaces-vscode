# Step 4: Debugging with Copilot

_Great refactoring work! Let's learn how Copilot can help with debugging._

## Debugging Techniques

Learn to use Copilot for finding and fixing bugs.

## :keyboard: Activity: Bug Finding

1. Use Copilot to analyze potential issues:
   ```typescript
   // analyze this code for potential memory leaks and performance issues
   ```

2. Generate test cases that might break the code:
   ```typescript
   // generate edge case tests that could expose bugs in this function
   ```

## :keyboard: Activity: Debug Logging

1. Add comprehensive logging:
   ```typescript
   // add detailed logging statements to trace the execution flow
   // include important variables and state changes
   ```

## :keyboard: Activity: Error Reproduction

1. Create minimal reproduction cases:
   ```typescript
   // create a minimal example that reproduces the race condition in this code
   ```

## :keyboard: Activity: Fix Suggestions

1. Get fix suggestions for known issues:
   ```typescript
   // suggest fixes for the memory leak in this component
   // explain the problems and their solutions
   ```

## Copilot Features Used:
- Code analysis
- Debug logging generation
- Test case generation
- Fix suggestions

## Tips
- Use clear, specific comments about the bug
- Ask Copilot to explain its suggestions
- Generate multiple test cases
- Use Copilot's suggestions as learning opportunities
