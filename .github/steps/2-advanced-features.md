# Step 2: Advanced Copilot Features

_Great work with basic completions! Let's explore advanced Copilot features._

## Advanced Features

Learn how to leverage Copilot's more powerful capabilities.

## :keyboard: Activity: Copilot Completions Panel

1. Open any TypeScript file
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` to open the Completions Panel
3. Try different comment styles:
